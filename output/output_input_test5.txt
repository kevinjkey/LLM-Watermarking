My Expectations


 I'm aiming to use Java to get to a degree in computer science. I'll learn Scala for some of the higher level concepts. I'm also targeting Google Summer of Code as a way to get my feet wet with open source. While I'm doing well at three degrees, there might be more prospects as a PhD.
