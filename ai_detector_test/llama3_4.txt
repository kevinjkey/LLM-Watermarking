your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Season an 8×8 cube pan with salt and pepper. In a 10-inch skillet, sauté the garlic until golden brown. Remove from heat and let cool. Once cooled, add the garlic to a large mixing bowl. Pour in half of the can of water, then add the cheese and onion. Mix well and let rest for 15 minutes.
Next, mash 2 cups of crusty bread - or use water, once the cheese and onion are added, the dough is ready. Note that the crust is a bread crust, so feel free to substitute with bread crumbs. After preparing the dough, spread the mixture on the bottom of the 8×8 pan.
