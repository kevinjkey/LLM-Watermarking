an incredible experienceâ€”not just because of the beautiful weather, but also because the food was outstanding. While much of the cuisine on Maui is takeout or quick service, one of the restaurants I visited, Birdhouse, is a local Hawaiian gem offering a fully vegan menu. For $40 per person, they served a range of meals, each accompanied by an ingredient list. If you're vegan and excited about this level of vegan dining in Hawaii, be sure to check out Vegan Gangsters Hawaii!
