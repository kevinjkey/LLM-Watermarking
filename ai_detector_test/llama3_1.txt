Apple released a new iPhone with an always-on feature. It comes with a specialized wireless charging pad, enabling charging from any surface. The back cover design eliminates the need for special cases, making this a unique product for Apple. This approach appears to be a first in the industry, and manufacturers seem to have made a significant effort. Apple gave away the phone at the Worldwide Developers Conference, which seems like a positive move. Now, Apple fans can access a new iPhone with fewer hurdles. The new model's distinct design might explain why people worldwide may prefer it over the iPhone 6.
