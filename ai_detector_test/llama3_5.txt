My Expectations
I aim to leverage Java to pursue a degree in computer science. Additionally, I plan to learn Scala to grasp higher-level concepts. Participating in Google Summer of Code is also a goal, as a means to gain experience with open-source projects. While I'm thriving in my current roles, further opportunities may arise with a PhD.
