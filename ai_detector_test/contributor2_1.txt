Apple has released the newest iPhone with an exciting new key feature: “always on” mode. It utilizes a specialized wireless charger, allowing the phone to charge anywhere. No special case is required to use this feature, making this unlike anything apple has produced before. No one else in the market has tried anything like this and Apple developers really fought hard to get this to market. At the worldwide developers conference, Apple gave this phone away allowing fans to get the new iPhone easily and quickly. The new look of this iPhone model is different than the iPhone 6 which everyone around the world already has.
