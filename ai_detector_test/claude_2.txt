awesome – not just due to the absolutely gorgeous weather but also because of the amazing food. While the majority of Maui's food options are quick service and take out, the restaurant I visited (a local Hawaiian place named Birdhouse) provides a completely vegan menu. For $40 per person, the restaurant offered a selection of dishes, each accompanied by ingredient lists. For those of you who are vegan and find this level of vegan service in Hawaii impressive, here's a tip – Vegan Gangsters Hawaii.
