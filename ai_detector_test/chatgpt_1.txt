Apple introduced a new iPhone featuring an always-on display. It includes a unique wireless charging pad that lets you charge the phone from any surface. The back cover doesn't need any special cases, making it a product Apple hasnâ€™t offered before. This approach seems to be heavily promoted by the manufacturers. Apple presented the phone at the Worldwide Developers Conference, which I believe was a smart move. Now, Apple fans can obtain the latest iPhone with fewer obstacles. The reason many people worldwide might still have an iPhone 6 is that the new model looks different.
