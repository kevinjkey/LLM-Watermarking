fresh fish and vegetables. If you can't pick your own mushrooms, you can try the sausage casing method. I found two sausage casings in a store window: one for snow crab, the other for shiitake mushrooms. The size difference was too big for the price difference, so I used snow crab casing for this recipe and shelled mushrooms for her recipe. If you can't get them for free at a grocery store, mushrooms will always provide that perfect breaded texture that melts in your mouth. Most fish cook up well in a butter sauce made with olive oil. Add the fish gradually, stirring.
