fresh fish and vegetables. If you can't gather your own mushrooms, you can utilize the sausage casing technique. I spotted two sausage casings in a store display: one for snow crab, another for shiitake mushrooms. The size disparity was too significant for the price difference, so I opted for snow crab casing in this recipe and shelled mushrooms for her recipe. If you're unable to find them for free at a grocery store, mushrooms will consistently provide that ideal breaded texture that dissolves in your mouth. Most fish cook well in a butter sauce made from olive oil. Introduce the fish gradually, stirring
